  Sources        API Calls        Format          Logic      Notifications
```

### **Key Components**
1. **Multi-GDS Integration**: Amadeus NDC/EDIFACT, Sabre, OTA systems
2. **UTR Normalization**: Source attribution, conflict resolution, quality assurance
3. **Rule Engine**: Context-aware Python execution with business logic
4. **Monaco Integration**: Professional development environment with debugging
5. **Action System**: Automated corrections, alerts, and GDS write-backs

### **Technology Stack**
- **Backend**: Go orchestrator, Python rule engine
- **Frontend**: Monaco Editor with TypeScript extensions
- **Data**: JSON-based UTR format with comprehensive schema
- **Integration**: REST APIs, WebSocket connections for real-time updates

## üìä **Performance Targets**

| Metric | Target | Current | Notes |
|--------|--------|---------|-------|
| Data Acquisition | < 2 seconds | - | Parallel GDS calls |
| UTR Normalization | < 500ms | - | Standard PNR processing |
| Rule Execution | < 1 second | - | Typical business rules |
| End-to-End Processing | < 3 seconds | - | Complete automation cycle |
| System Availability | 99.99% | - | With intelligent failover |
| Data Accuracy | > 99.5% | - | Across all sources |

## üöÄ **Implementation Status**

### **Completed ‚úÖ**
- UTR schema design with comprehensive templates
- Monaco editor unified system with IntelliSense
- Rule testing framework with step-by-step debugging
- Multi-source UTR normalization schemas
- Business rules execution engine
- Python code generation system

### **In Progress üîÑ**
- UTR-Rule Tester integration (connecting schemas to testing)
- Real-time vendor data retrieval for testing
- Email override system for rule notifications
- Workflow-aware rule execution

### **Critical Integration Gap (Immediate Priority) ‚ö†Ô∏è**
- **UTR Connection**: Rule tester uses mock data instead of real UTR objects
- **Vendor Integration**: No `vendor.get()` calls for consolidated UTR data
- **Source Attribution**: Testing lacks multi-source GDS context
- **Email Overrides**: No delivery control for rule testing notifications

### **Next Phase üìã**
- Machine learning integration for rule optimization
- Continuous learning engine for pattern recognition
- Autonomous operation mode for production workflows
- Advanced analytics dashboard for performance monitoring
