# ✈️ Product Brief: [Product Name]
*Intelligent Workflow Automation for GDS-Connected Travel Systems*

## Overview  
[Product Name] is a rules- and workflow-based automation engine purpose-built for travel agencies using Sabre, Amadeus, or other GDS platforms. It audits and corrects booking records via scheduled or on-demand jobs, ensuring data completeness and compliance through intelligent rule execution.

The platform can initiate workflows from scheduled jobs or **deep links**, allowing instant routing and context-aware job execution directly from external systems.

---

## Key Architecture  

A **Job** can be initiated via:

- 🕒 **Scheduled Execution** – Pulled from queues based on time, office ID, and workflow config  
- 🔗 **Deep Link URL** – Jobs can be started on-demand from a web link, with **encoded return values** containing:  
  - `officeId`  
  - `PNR`  
  - `workflowId`  
  - Additional runtime data for dynamic execution  

Each job triggers a **Go-based workflow engine**, using GDS API calls to load and mutate PNR data, applying custom business logic defined in **processes and rules**.

---

## Core Capabilities  

- ⚙️ **Workflow Engine** – Executes composable processes built from rules  
- 🔁 **Bi-Directional GDS Integration** – Reads and writes PNRs via Sabre/Amadeus APIs  
- 🌐 **Deep Link Job Triggers** – Start jobs directly from browser links with encoded metadata  
- 📦 **Structured Job Object** – Contains office ID, run time, node ID, workflow ID, and rule package  
- 📬 **Agent/System Notifications** – Sends alerts for flagged or fixed records  
- 🚦 **Node-Based Routing** – Supports multi-step logic across branches or agent flows  
- 🔧 **Centralized API** – All rule updates funnel through one control point for consistency and logging  

---

## Use Cases  

- Validate GDS records for cars, hotels, dates, payments  
- Trigger workflows from an agent dashboard or CRM via deep links  
- Auto-fix or flag errors via GDS write-back logic  
- Route jobs dynamically by agency office, client type, or booking status
